# DevSoc Subcommittee Recruitment Platforms Technical

Your task is to send a direct message to the matrix handle `@chino:oxn.sh` using the Matrix protocol. However, this message must be sent over a self hosted instance such as through the Conduwuit implementation or the slightly more complicated Synapse implementation.

For this to work your server must be federated, but you do not have to worry about specifics such as using your domain name as your handle (a subdomain will do!) or have other 'nice to have' features. Just a message will do!

If you don't manage to get this working we'll still want to hear about what you tried, what worked and what didn't work, etc. Good luck!
