# DevSoc 2025 Subcommittee Recruitment Frontend Technical

## Overview and Expectations

- You will be given an image of a website. **Your goal is to recreate this image as a page**.
- You can (and we would prefer) that you implement your solution in this directory, though you may choose to create your own repository
- This is a qualitative technical assessment that will be reviewed by Project Directors to make a judgment on progressing your application to an interview.
- There are no exact marks associated with the completion of individual components. Your code will be judged on its structure, style and adherence to frontend conventions to create a visually similar product to the specified goal.
- This technical task is **not compulsory**. You may judge the relevance of this task to the project and role you are applying for.
  - We will be making a judgement based on your holistic application which includes your application answers and may include either or both this and the backend task.

## Tasks

### Main Task

### Stretch Task 1

### Stretch Task 2

## Submission

Please submit the link to your fork of the repo in the application form. You may choose to implement your solution in a separate, fresh repository. If so, please share the link to this repository within `instructions.txt`.

If your solution is not accessible through an `index.html` file or run via a standard `npm i` `npm run start` command, please fill out `instructions.txt` with instructions on how we can open your solution in our browser and any dependencies that we may need.

## Additional comment

Whilst most of our frontend applicants tend to have frontend experience, either through self-study, work or COMP6080, we are open to candidates of varying experiences and abilities. The most important characteristics are one's curiosity and willingness to self-teach/learn. We have had frontend members join with little prior experience and go on to learn and contribute significantly. Therefore, if you find a lot of these exercises difficult, do not be disheartened - please make an attempt.
