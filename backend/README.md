# DevSoc Backend Technical Assessment

## Background

## Tasks

### Task 1

### Task 2

### Task 3

## Testing

Basic assert-based tests are provided in each language, but they are not comprehensive, and we recommend doing some manual testing to ensure your solutions are correct.

You can compile and run the tests using the given `run.sh` scripts by running the command

```
./run.sh
```

from within the directory of your chosen language.

These scripts assume you have the required compilers/runtimes installed for your chosen language. The C/C++ compiler used is configurable within `run.sh`.

## Submission

To submit, push your solutions to your fork and submit a link to the fork in the application form. Your submissions will be reviewed by our Project Directors and considered holistically, taking in to account correctness, efficiency and code style.
